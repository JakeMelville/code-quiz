# New York Jets Quiz

## Application
This application is desgined to provide a quiz for the user. Once the start button is pressed the game will begin. The user has 60 seconds to answer 5 multiple choice question. However, every wrong answer docs 10 seconds off the timer! When the quiz concludes the user will be able to enter initials and save highscores.

## Technologies Used
I used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for this application. In addtion I also used bootstrap to help style the page and J Query to access elements from the HTML.
## Problems Faced
I was having difficulty getting both the questions and answers to cycle through using Event Listeners.

## How to use
This application is quite simple to use. After pressing the start button the user will then select the correct answer to each question. When an answer is selected the application will inform the user if they are correct or incorrect. At the end of the 5 questions the application will record the users score.
